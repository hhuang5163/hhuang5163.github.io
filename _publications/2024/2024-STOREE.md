  To increase knowledge of robot behavior amongst end users, an emerging technique called policy summarization computationally generates key examples of robot behavior. The current literature in policy summarization mainly focuses on teaching in simulation by showing examples of the robot's behavior to its end users, a method that emphasizes teaching mappings from state to action. However, robotics relies on the sense-plan-act paradigm, and there is little work in policy summarization that aims to teach a mapping from observations to action. In this work, we formalize the gaps in simulation-based XAI, most of which do not factor in perception. We propose STOREE: Sim-TO-Real Explanations for Embodied AI, a method for users to learn a robot's behavior in new scenarios exclusively in simulation.
