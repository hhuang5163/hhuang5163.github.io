  <p>
  I specialize in human-centered artificial intelligence, focusing on AI transparency and improving human-robot collaboration. 
  Currently, Iâ€™m a researcher in a Human-Centered AI and Robotics Lab, where I explore how AI can help people better understand and work alongside intelligent systems. I aim to design AI that both supports people in their tasks and makes working with technology more intuitive and effective.
