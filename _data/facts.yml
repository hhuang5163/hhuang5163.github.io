  fact: "My research is focused on Human-Centered AI and Robotics."
  subtext: "I am particularly interested in how AI can be used to enhance human capabilities and improve user experiences. 
            More specifically, my work is in explainable AI, a collection of approaches that aim to make black-box AI systems more transparent to their users.
            Explainable AI approaches have been shown to be effective in helping users understand robot behavior."

  fact: "Policy summarization is a subfield of explainable AI that focuses on generating concise summaries of complex robot policies."
  subtext: "Policy summarization aims to provide users with selected summaries of complex robot policies to enhance their understanding and trust in AI systems.
            My research in this area involves developing methods to incorporate personalization into policy summarization to select examples of robot behavior that are tailored to each user.
            These explanations can help users understand how robots will behave in specific situations, thereby improving their trust and collaboration with AI systems, especially in critical scenarios."

  fact: "My research, PPS: Personalized Policy Summarization, has been published at the AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES) 2024."
  subtext: "Policy summarization methods aim to showcase key examples of agent behaviors to their human users. 
            Yet, existing methods produce “one-size-fits-all” summaries for a generic audience ahead of time. 
            Personalized Policy Summarization (PPS). PPS discerns a user’s mental model of the 
            agent through a series of algorithmically generated questions and crafts customized policy summaries to enhance user understanding. 
            Unlike existing methods, PPS actively engages with users to gauge their comprehension of the agent behavior, subsequently generating tailored explanations on the fly. 
            Through a combination of numerical and human subject experiments, we confirmed the utility of this personalized approach to explainable AI."
